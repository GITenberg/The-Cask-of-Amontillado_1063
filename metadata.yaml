description: The story is set in a nameless Italian city in an unspecified year (possibly
  sometime during the eighteenth century) and concerns the deadly revenge taken by
  the narrator on a friend who he claims has insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories,
  and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative
  revolves around a person being buried alive--in this case, by immurement.
